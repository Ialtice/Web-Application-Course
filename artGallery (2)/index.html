            <p>
                My name is Parul Charkole and I am a student attending the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
                I have been making art work ever since I could remember and it is my main hobby and possible future
                profession. My art projects have won many awards through grade school along with awards for amateur artists.
                I have experience in water,oil,pastel,and acrylic painting, pencil base, and purely digital.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a artist because it is something I truly have a passion for and it has brought me happiness every since
                I was a child. It allows me to express myself and bring joy to others as I make their project ideas come true. It
                is a challenging hobby that I look forward to bringing up to a professional level.
