        <h3>Watercolor Painting</h3>
            <div id="tabs-1">
                <p>
                    I have been doing watercolor painting for four years now and is one of my favorite styles. Watercolor painting mixes
                    painting pigments with water to make amazing visuals on paper that have a lighter and more vibrant color scheme than most.

        <h3>Oil Painting</h3>
        <div id="tabs-2">
            <p>
                Oil painting is my favorite painting style and is my most practiced. I have been doing this style for 10 years now.
                Oil painting allows for the most variability when working with it but also takes the longest time to complete. Painting will have
                great color depth and texture.

        <h3>Pastel Painting</h3>
        <div id="tabs-3">
            <p>
                Pastel painting is a style that is between painting and drawing. I have been practicing this kind art for three years.
                The artworks will be similar in appearance to other types of paintings but will often take less time and the process in making them
                is more similar to drawing.
            </p>

        <h3>Acrylic Painting</h3>
        <div id="tabs-4">
            <p>
                Acrylic painting is the easiest and most versatile type of painting. In this style I can mimic the look of oil and water based
                paints but they will be more durable. These types of paintings are  flexible, almost completely non-toxic, and resistant to water.
                I have been working with this style for 12 years and was the first type of painting I started with.

        <h3>Pencil Art</h3>
        <div id="tabs-5">
            <p>
                This styling of art work is the one that I began with as a child. It involves using colored pencils and a variety
                of techniques to make beautiful artworks.I have been working with this style of art work since I started drawing and was
                where I won my first awards.

        <h3>Digital Art</h3>
        <div id="tabs-6">
            <p>
                Digital art is the most modern art style I practice and covers a lot of different projects. I enjoy this type of work as I
                can replicate all the different painting styles digitally without waiting for the materials to dry or having to hunt down the perfect color
                as they are all digital. This also makes it my cheapest and most modifiable art style.
