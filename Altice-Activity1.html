<h1>Web-Based Applications Design and Development</h1>
<h2>Me and My Course</h2>

<p><i><b>Isaac Altice</b></i> is a senior in his last semester at UNCC. He is graduating with a Bachelor in Computer science 
    with a concentration in Software, Systems, and Networking with a minor in business. He is currently seeking any internship opportunities
    in the field of software engineering or network administration. He has not done any work with HTML and CSS recently but is looking forward to a refresher of these 
    topics and gaining new skills. 
</p>

<p><i><b>Isaac Altice</b></i> is choosing to take this course in Web App Design and Development to <em>gain more experience and have new skills to add to his resume and new projects
    to add to his portfolio to demonstrate his working knowledge to future employers.</em> He believes it is important to have a good general knowledge in most of the common areas of programming.
    He also thinks this will be a fun and enjoyable class to have in his last semester.
</p>

<p><i><b>Isaac Altice </b></i> expects to learn in this course by reading the assigned text books, doing assignments/labs, and communicating with classmates and TAs 
    when encountering problems or wanting clarification on topics. He prefers to do a majority of work alone and then meeting in a small group to compare notes 
    and go over the material with other students. He learns best by making detailed notes and looking through them while completing tasks.
